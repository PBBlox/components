## j-Search

Simple fulltext search component. This component can show/hide elements according to the searching phrase.

- jComponent `v19|v20`

__Configuration__:

- `selector {String}` jQuery selector for searching
- `attribute {String}` element attribute which contains a search phrase (default: `data-search`)
- `class {String}` this class will be used if the element is not found (default: `hidden`)
- `delay {Number}` typing delay (default: `50` ms)
- `delaydatasource {Number}` a delay for re-search when the data-source is changed (default: `100` ms)
- __UPD__ `exec {String}` a link to `function(stats:{ total: Number, count: Number, hidden: Number, search: String, is: Boolean })` which will be evaluated if the component searches for something
- `datasource {String}` a path to data-source for watching of changes
- `splitwords {Boolean}` tries to find word in various position (default: `true`)
- __NEW__ `custom {String}` a path to the `Function(element, search) must return Boolean` for custom searching

__Good to know__:

This component adds the classes below automatically when:

- class `ui-search-used` is added when the user searches for something
- class `ui-search-empty` is added when the user searches for something and at the same time nothing was found
